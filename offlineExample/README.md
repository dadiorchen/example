This is a demo for offline/ service worker project

The create-react-app is great ,using it , we can test offline directly :
* build the project : npm run build
* install HTTP server : npm -g install serve
* run server: serve -s build/
* visit the offline-able project: https://localhost:5000

And can use it in development env with  HTTPS
* HTTPS=true npm start
